# crudProjectJava
In this crud project, there is 1 module which is Admin. Admin can perform all operations with the table, like Read, Write, Update, and delete the entry of table using this java program.
 Here I have used JDBC to connect our Java Application to Database. Where database software is 'Postgresql'.

 So, there is one database whose name is---->> collegestaff.
 Table Name---->> employee
 A number of cols--->> [5], empid, name, mobile, city, dept where empid is set to auto increment.

 Number of Class--->> [JdbcConnection] and [CreateQuery, ReadQuery, UpdateQery, DeleteQuery]. this class does not have a main method.
  Another class is AdminModule where the main method is started.

  -------------Imp  information------------

  If you want to do a copy of this repo you can do it. But before running this project in your system, you should have set up of database and jar files.
